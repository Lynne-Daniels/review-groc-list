## FILL ME IN

todo: 

1. take screenshot of current working app so that you can show the students a wireframe of what you're making
2. rip out pretty much all of the code here - though maybe leave the files empty
3. break into discrete pieces, decide who is doing what

roughly: 
0. explain wireframe/app
1. architecture diagram
2. front end (in isolation)
3. server (in isolation)
4. database (in isolation)
5. sequence diagram
6. connect db and server
7. connect server and front end

suggestion: YOU MAY want to do steps 0 through 7 with just the transaction list (NOT THE ADD PART) then leave the add part as an exercise for them# hrsf81-82-sunday-review-workshop
